# GEO Sensor Code
Los Encendidos 2021-2022

This branch (master) contains the code that is currently found on the Arduino.

* The sensor code does not yet calibrate any of the results returned by the sensors
* For increased readibility the code is now organized into a sensor.ino file and several header files with corresponding .cpp files for each sensor.

The other pieces of code from last year's team can be found on their corresponding branches.
